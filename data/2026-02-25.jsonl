AI has been validated as a clinical decision aid in providing accurate, rapid real-time analysis of echocardiographic images. Building on this, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), a routine part of electrophysiology procedures, to guide clinicians toward areas of arrhythmogenesis and potentially reduce procedural time. Arrhythmia source localization is formulated as a three-class classification task, distinguishing normal sinus rhythm, left-sided, and right-sided arrhythmias, based on ICE video data. We developed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network trained to discriminate among the three aforementioned classes. In ten-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean accuracy of 66.2% when evaluated on four previously unseen patients (substantially outperforming the 33.3% random baseline). These results demonstrate the feasibility and clinical promise of using ICE videos combined with deep learning for automated arrhythmia localization. Leveraging ICE imaging could enable faster, more targeted electrophysiological interventions and reduce the procedural burden of cardiac ablation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset to improve model robustness and generalizability across diverse patient populations."}

By minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between the full and pruned token distributions, OTPrune preserves both local diversity and global representativeness while reducing inference cost. Moreover, we derive a tractable submodular objective that enables efficient optimization, and theoretically prove its monotonicity and submodularity, providing a principled foundation for stable and efficient pruning.

Rule-based visualization linters can flag violations, but they miss context and do not suggest meaningful design changes. Directly querying general-purpose LLMs about visualization quality is unreliable: lacking training to follow visualization design principles, they often produce inconsistent or incorrect feedback. In this work, we introduce a framework that combines chart de-rendering, automated analysis, and iterative improvement to deliver actionable, interpretable feedback on visualization design. Our system reconstructs the structure of a chart from an image, identifies design flaws using vision-language reasoning, and proposes concrete modifications supported by established principles in visualization research. Users can selectively apply these improvements and re-render updated figures, creating a feedback loop that promotes both higher-quality visualizations and the development of visualization literacy. In our evaluation on 1,000 charts from the Chart2Code benchmark, the system generated 10,452 design recommendations, which clustered into 10 coherent categories (e.g., axis formatting, color accessibility, legend consistency). These results highlight the promise of LLM-driven recommendation systems for delivering structured, principle-based feedback on visualization design, opening the door to more intelligent and accessible authoring tools."}

Specifically, N4MC converts consecutive irregular mesh frames into regular 4D tensors to provide a uniform and compact representation. These tensors are then condensed using an auto-decoder, which captures both spatial and temporal correlations for redundancy removal. To enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a transformer-based interpolation model that predicts intermediate mesh frames conditioned on latent embeddings derived from tracked volume centers, eliminating motion ambiguities. Extensive evaluations show that N4MC outperforms state-of-the-art in rate-distortion performance, while enabling real-time decoding of 4D mesh sequences.

Across 50 evaluation scenarios, it maintains performance comparable to the original model and achieves the best results in 40 cases, outperforming common baselines such as layer freezing and external data mixing. Guided by these empirical findings, we further present a theoretical analysis suggesting that forgetting can partly stem from style-induced parameter drift, and that self-alignment through self-generated data provides an effective means to counteract this effect. Overall, our results indicate that self-augmentation offers a simple and effective mechanism for robust LLM adaptation without incurring catastrophic forgetting."}

Common image priors promote solutions on the general image manifold, such as sparsity, smoothness, or score function. However, as these priors do not constrain the null-space component, they can bias the reconstruction. Thus, we aim to incorporate meaningful null-space information in the reconstruction framework. Inspired by smooth image representation on graphs, we propose Graph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR), a mechanism that imposes structure only into the invisible component. Particularly, given a graph Laplacian, we construct a null-restricted Laplacian that encodes similarity between neighboring pixels in the null-space signal, and we design a low-dimensional projection matrix from the $p$-smoothest spectral graph modes (lowest graph frequencies). This approach has strong theoretical and practical implications: i) improved convergence via a null-only graph regularizer, ii) better coverage, how much null-space variance is captured by $p$ modes, and iii) high predictability, how well these modes can be inferred from the measurements. GSNR is incorporated into well-known inverse problem solvers, e.g., PnP, DIP, and diffusion solvers, in four scenarios: image deblurring, compressed sensing, demosaicing, and image super-resolution, providing consistent improvement of up to 4.3 dB over baseline formulations and up to 1 dB compared with end-to-end learned models in terms of PSNR."}

A common strategy is to train a reflection model as a filter to intercept false alerts with labelled data collected from user verification feedback. However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets."}

Our evaluation framework enables principled method selection based on application requirements, and our empirical findings provide actionable insights for advancing personality simulation research."}

Drawing on classical linguistics, we argue that a query's form can also shape a listener's (and model's) response. We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies."}

For video generators to be useful for applications ranging from robotics to film-making, they must consistently produce realistic videos. However, evaluating the realism of generated videos remains a largely manual process -- requiring human annotation or bespoke evaluation datasets which have restricted scope. Here we develop an automated evaluation framework for video realism which captures both semantics and coherent 3D structure and which does not require access to a reference video. Our method, 3DSPA, is a 3D spatiotemporal point autoencoder which integrates 3D point trajectories, depth cues, and DINO semantic features into a unified representation for video evaluation. 3DSPA models how objects move and what is happening in the scene, enabling robust assessments of realism, temporal consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments show that 3DSPA reliably identifies videos which violate physical laws, is more sensitive to motion artifacts, and aligns more closely with human judgments of video quality and realism across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that enriching trajectory-based representations with 3D semantics offers a stronger foundation for benchmarking generative video models, and implicitly captures physical rule violations.

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

In this work, we introduce the notion of 3D aesthetic field that enables geometry-grounded aesthetic reasoning in 3D with sparse captures, allowing efficient viewpoint suggestions in contrast to costly RL searches. We opt to learn this 3D aesthetic field using a feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting network that distills high-level aesthetic knowledge from a pretrained 2D aesthetic model into 3D space, enabling aesthetic prediction for novel viewpoints from only sparse input views. Building on this field, we propose a two-stage search pipeline that combines coarse viewpoint sampling with gradient-based refinement, efficiently identifying aesthetically appealing viewpoints without dense captures or RL exploration.

Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics. Finally, an action-priority decoding strategy is introduced to prioritize trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and derived benchmarks demonstrate that MVLAD-AD achieves superior efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in planning precision, while providing high-fidelity and explainable reasoning."}

To accelerate research in this domain, we open-source our model checkpoints and most of our synthetic datasets at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-terminal."}

However, a fundamental parametric gap remains: existing models rely on descriptive language, whereas professional workflows require precise numeric control over object location, size, and color. In this work, we introduce BBQ, a large-scale text-to-image model that directly conditions on numeric bounding boxes and RGB triplets within a unified structured-text framework. We obtain precise spatial and chromatic control by training on captions enriched with parametric annotations, without architectural modifications or inference-time optimization. This also enables intuitive user interfaces such as object dragging and color pickers, replacing ambiguous iterative prompting with precise, familiar controls. Across comprehensive evaluations, BBQ achieves strong box alignment and improves RGB color fidelity over state-of-the-art baselines. More broadly, our results support a new paradigm in which user intent is translated into an intermediate structured language, consumed by a flow-based transformer acting as a renderer and naturally accommodating numeric parameters."}

Website: https://social-ai-studio.github.io/CHAIN/", "summary": "Understanding the physical structure is essential for real-world applications such as embodied agents, interactive design, and long-horizon manipulation. Yet, prevailing Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structure-agnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents' ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in a dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings. Our results show that top-performing models still struggle to internalize physical structure and causal constraints, often failing to produce reliable long-horizon plans and cannot robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions.

Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

However, their clinical adoption has been hindered by a major requirement: training datasets with manually annotated landmarks that maintain point-to-point correspondences across patients rarely exist in practice. We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses. Beyond direct segmentation, Mask-HybridGNet can extract correspondences from existing segmentation masks, allowing it to generate stable anatomical atlases from any high-quality pixel-based model. Experiments across chest radiography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, and fetal imaging demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art pixel-based methods, while ensuring anatomical plausibility by enforcing boundary connectivity through a fixed graph adjacency matrix. This framework leverages the vast availability of standard segmentation masks to build structured models that maintain topological integrity and provide implicit correspondences."}

Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results highlight PSFM as a scalable path toward advancing spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Spa3R."}

However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs."}

Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are segmented as single entities. Here, we developed TomoROIS-SurfORA, a two step framework for direct, shape-agnostic ROI segmentation and morphological surface analysis. TomoROIS performs deep learning-based ROI segmentation and can be trained from scratch using small annotated datasets, enabling practical application across diverse imaging data. SurfORA processes segmented structures as point clouds and surface meshes to extract quantitative morphological features, including inter-membrane distances, curvature, and surface roughness. It supports both closed and open surfaces, with specific considerations for open surfaces, which are common in cryo-ET due to the missing wedge effect. We demonstrate both tools using in vitro reconstituted membrane systems containing deformable vesicles with complex geometries, enabling automatic quantitative analysis of membrane contact sites and remodeling events such as invagination. While demonstrated here on cryo-ET membrane data, the combined approach is applicable to ROI detection and surface analysis in broader scientific imaging contexts."}
