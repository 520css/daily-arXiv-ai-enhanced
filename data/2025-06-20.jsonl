This joint formulation enhances\nimplicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting\neffects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and\ntransparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive\nautomatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong\ngeneralization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both\nvisual fidelity and temporal consistency."}

However, existing video\ngeneration datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they\nsuffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,\nand a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we\nintroduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person\nview worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It\nconsists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from\nover 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and\neffective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,\nscene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments\ndemonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an\ninteractive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in\nJapanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world\nexploration, and motivate valuable applications."}

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.
